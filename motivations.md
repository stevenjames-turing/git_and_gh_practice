My family is my motivation to change my career. I've been working in Real Estate for the last ~7 years and have (mostly) loved my job. However, RE requires agents to be available on evenings and weekends which takes time away from my family. I am excited to enter a new career path that will allow me to feel fulfilled with my work, but also give me better flexibility to spend time with my son as he grows.
